# 🌍 World Happiness Score Prediction – ML Deployment

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from model training and feature selection to web deployment using Flask.

## 🔹 Project Overview
- Built a regression model to predict World Happiness Score
- Applied feature scaling and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Solved feature mismatch issues during deployment
- Deployed the model using Flask with a dynamic user interface

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask
- Joblib

## 🔹 Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
3. Feature selection (RFE)
4. Model training
5. Model serialization using Joblib
6. Web deployment using Flask

## 🔹 How to Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
